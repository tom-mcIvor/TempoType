# GitHub Linguist overrides to improve repository language statistics.
# Mark generated reports, build artifacts and vendored dependencies so they
# are excluded from language detection and don't cause the repo to appear
# dominated by HTML or other generated file types.

coverage/** linguist-generated
coverage/* linguist-generated

# Browser-facing public assets that may include many HTML files

# Vendored packages and virtual envs

# Common build / output folders
